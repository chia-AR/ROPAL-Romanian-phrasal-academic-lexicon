#### Abstract
The lack of NLP based research studies on academic writing in Romania results in an unbalanced development of automatic support tools in Romanian compared to other languages, such as English. For this study, we use Romanian subsets of two bilingual academic writing corpora: the ROGER corpus, consisting of university student papers, and the EXPRES corpus, composed of expert research articles. Working with the Romanian Academic Word List / Ro-AWL, we present two phrase extraction phases: (i) use Ro-AWL words as node words to extract collocations according to the thresholds of statistical measures and (ii) classify extracted phrases into general versus domain-specific multi-word units. We show how manual rhetorical function annotation of resulting phrases can be combined with automatic function detection. The comparison between academic phrases in ROGER and EXPRES validates the final phrase list. The Romanian phrasal academic lexicon (ROPAL), similar to the Oxford Phrasal Academic Lexicon (OPAL), is a written academic phrase lexicon for Romanian language made available for academic use and further research or applications.
